# Testing TypeScript with Mocha

Typescript is set up and there's a function `simpleGreeting` defined in `src/greetings.ts`

We've installed Mocha and Chai, as well as their types.\
`npm install --save-dev mocha @types/mocha chai @types/chai`

- Mocha is the test runner.
- Chai is the assertion library we've chosen to use for our tests.

We've also installed ts-node, which will be used to compile typescript on-the-fly.\
`npm install ts-node`
